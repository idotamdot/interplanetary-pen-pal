## Understanding Star Rarity 💎

Stars come in 6 rarity tiers:

| Rarity | Color | Score | Chat? |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Common | Gray | 0-20 | ❌ |
| Uncommon | Green | 20-40 | 5% chance (30s) |
| Rare | Blue | 40-60 | 15% chance (60s) |
| Epic | Purple | 60-80 | 30% chance (90s) |
| Legendary | Orange | 80-95 | 60% chance (120s) |
| Mythic | Gold | 95-100 | 95% chance (180s) |

**Rarity is affected by:**
- Base star rarity
- Star category (Ancient and Celestial stars are rarer)
- Time of day (night = higher rarity)
- Season (winter = higher rarity)
